# HiOp Documentation

HiOp's [user manual](hiop_usermanual.pdf) provides instructions on how to obtain and build HiOp and a description of
its interface, user options, and use as an optimization library. Guidelines on how is best to use
the solver for parallel computations are also provided.

The mathematical approach, computational technique, and parallelization strategy and efficiency are described in the 
accompanying [technical report](hiop_implpaper.pdf) (publication pending).
